# Better Go Playground

The "Better Go Playground" extension makes the Go Playground easier to use by:

 - Golang syntax highlighting
 - Replaces the built in with the Ace editor
 - Mark lines with syntax errors when running your code
 - Auto-completion + Snippets
 - Auto-save to local storage
 - Dark/Light theme toggle


### TODO
- The migration to Gulp 4 doesnt seem to be working properly and is not generating a correct package.
